# GrabCut Cellphaser Plugin Evaluation

I'm evaluating my implementation of a [GrabCut](https://cvg.ethz.ch/teaching/cvl/2012/grabcut-siggraph04.pdf) interface for clinical researchers to assist them with their data annotation tasks on blood phase images.

For this, I am considering the following three aspects

1. Effort

2. Performance

3. Disagreement

based on a unsupervised user study conducted over the course of a month.
